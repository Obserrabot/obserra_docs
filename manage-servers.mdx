### 1. Go to the Server Settings Page

The easiest way to add new servers is through our web dashboard. Navigate to your network's dashboard, go to **Settings → Manage Servers**, and you'll be on the correct page.

### 2. Adding New Servers

Click the **Add Server** button at the top right. You'll see two options for adding a new server. The first is the most straightforward and works in most cases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Adding via the GUI">
    <Info>
      This option only works for servers where you have Administrator permissions.
    </Info>

    First, the bot needs to be a member of the server. If it hasn’t joined yet, scroll down to the **Invite Bot to Other Servers** section. There, you’ll see a list of all servers where you have Administrator permissions and where the bot isn't present. Click **Add to Server**, follow the Discord pop-up instructions, and the bot will join your server.

    Once the bot is in the server, go to the **Add Your Managed Server** section. Here, you'll see a list of servers where the bot is present but not yet added to your network. If your server appears in this list, simply click **Add to Network**, and you're all set. If it doesn't appear, make sure:
    - You have Administrator permissions,
    - The bot has joined the server (check the section above),
    - The server hasn’t already been added to the network (check the Manage Servers page).

    After adding it, continue with step 3 to manage the server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adding Manually by Server ID">
    <Info>
      This method is for servers where you **don’t** have Administrator permissions.

      The server owner must accept your invite.
    </Info>

    First, invite the bot to the server. Then, retrieve the **Server ID** and enter it in the **Add Server by ID** section under **Add Server to Network**. Click **Add**. If the request is successful, you’ll receive a notification. The server owner will then receive a direct message from Observerbot asking whether they want to accept your invite. The server will only appear in your network if they accept.
  </Step>
