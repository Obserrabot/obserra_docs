Simply click on the Add to Server button, follow the Discord Popups instructions and the Bot is on you Server.

    To connect the Server to your Network you will now need the "Add Your Managed Server" section, here you cann add Server to your Network if the Bot has already joined the Server, you will only see erver in which the Bot is in and Server that wasnt added to the network yet, if the Bot isn't listed here check if you have Admin permission, if the Server is listed in the Invite Bot to Other Server section (follow steps above) or if the Server is already connected to the Network and the Manage Servers page (as described below). If the Server is listed just click the Add to network button and you are all set, from step 3 on you will learn how to manage this server.
