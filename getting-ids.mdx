### Why You Need Discord IDs

During the setup and configuration of the bot, you’ll often need to provide **Discord IDs** — such as for:

- Servers (Guilds)
- Channels
- Roles
- Users

These IDs are required when assigning permissions, linking appeal servers, or configuring advanced bot features. Discord does **not** display these IDs by default, so you’ll need to enable Developer Mode first.

### 1. Enable Developer Mode

To see and copy Discord IDs, you need to turn on **Developer Mode** in your Discord settings.

#### Steps:

1. Open **User Settings** (bottom left corner on Discord)
2. Go to **Advanced** under _App Settings_
3. Toggle on **Developer Mode**

<img
  src="/images/activate-discord-dev-mode.png"
  alt="Activate Discord Dev Mode Pn"
  title="Activate Discord Dev Mode Pn"
  style={{ width:"70%" }}
/>

Once Developer Mode is enabled, you can right-click almost anything in Discord (servers, messages, users, channels, roles) and copy its ID.
