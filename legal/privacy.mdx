4. Google Analytics

This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

Google Analytics uses "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

We have activated IP anonymization on this website. Your IP address will be truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before transmission to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.

The storage of Google Analytics cookies and the use of this analysis tool are based on your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR), which you provide to us via our consent banner.

You can revoke your consent at any time by:

Preventing the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser software settings; however, we would like to point out that in this case, you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent.

7. SSL Encryption & HSTS

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as inquiries you send to us, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize this by the fact that the address bar of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. By activating HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), it is also ensured that your browser always accesses our website via a secure HTTPS connection. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
