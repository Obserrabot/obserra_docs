## Getting started for free

It just takes two simple steps to get Obserra Bot up and running:

### 1. Login to our Dashboard

Head over to our Dashboard at [dashboard.obserra.bot](http://dashboard.obserra.bot) and login with you Discord Account. After that you can create a so called "Network" which gives you the ability to group Servers, to manage them all together. If you just want to manage one Server you will also need to create a Network.

### 2. Add Servers to you Network / Invite the Bot

After that head over to the "Settings" page and than to the "Server Settings" page, here you can click on add a Server. On the page you will be prompted to select one or multiple Server the Bot is in to add it to your Network. If the bot is in none of your Servers you will be prompted to Invite the Bot to one of your Servers with just a click of a button on the page.

And that's it your Obserra Bot is now ready to be configured for your personal needs.
