<Warning>
  To manage permissions, make sure you have set a Head Server. All your team members must be in this server.
</Warning>

Obserra allows you to manage permissions for specific Discord roles and assign exactly what they are allowed and not allowed to do in your Network.

To set it up, head over to your Network's Settings page and then to **Permissions**.

Obserra works by creating permission groups which you then can assign Discord roles to. Users with those roles on your Head Server will have the permissions defined in the group on the Dashboard and the Bot itself.

# Setting up Permission Groups

### 1. Create a Permission Group

Scroll to the bottom of the Permission management page. You can activate specific permissions (which you can edit later) and give the group a unique name, e.g. **Moderators**.

You can see a list of all available permissions and their effects below.

### 2. Assign Discord Roles to a Permission Group

After creating your permission group, expand it with the little arrow next to its name. Here you can edit the permissions and assign Discord roles from your Head Server to this group.

> **Note:** Only roles from your Head Server, defined in your Server settings, can be assigned here.

<Tip>
  You can assign multiple roles to a single group.
