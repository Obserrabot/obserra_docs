<Warning>
  To manage Permission make sure you have set a Head server, all your Teammebers must be in this Server.
</Warning>

Obserra allows you to manage Permission for specific Discordroles and assign them exactly what they are allowed and what they aren't allowed to do in your Network.

To set it up head over to your Networks Settings page and then to Permissions.

<Info>
  Obserra works by creating permission groups which you than can assign Discord roles to, users with that role on your Headserver will have the permission defined in the Group on the Dashbaord and the Bot itselfs.
</Info>

# Setting up Permission groups

### 1. Create a Permission group

Scroll to the bottom of the Permission management page, you can active specific permission (you can edit this also later) and give the Group a unique name, e.g. Moderators.

You can see an list of all avaliable permission and their impact here:

### 2. Assigning Discord Roles to a Permission group

After you have created you Permission group you can expand you group with the little arrow and the right next to it's name. Here you can edit the permission if you want to and assign Discord roles from you Headserver to this group. Note: Only roles from you Headserver, defined in your Server settings can be assigned here.

<Tip>
  You can have multiple Roles assigned to a single Group
